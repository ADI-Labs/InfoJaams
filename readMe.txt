End goals:
Give people access to internet info without the internet (using cellphone data to text queries to a number that would be linked to this web app)
Have a personalized account for each user (based on either their individual phone number or giving them a specific phone number to consistently send messages through)
Store info about search queries/history
Healthcare: store personal info about health stats
A bit ambitious: offline application that sends texts for you (user goes through a series of prompts (which would be in a graphic/interactive form aka easier to use than text) about what they're looking for, then the app helps you send a text with a detailed search query (not sure how this would be formatted)
For next week:
Learn/scope out Ruby
Do more research on each subcategory (find examples/ how it generally would work)
List of features:
What if they type in something vague?
Returning Google results (should we just break this down by category?)
Top 5 results
Or, take THE top result (as determined by Google when you search certain stats about population, etc.)
Also works for looking up definitions of words
Healthcare (Sam)
Hearing test
Specific cases for emergency situations?
What kind of results do we want to return for this?
Sports/News (Maddie)
Live updates
User can ask for updates every 5, 10 minutues
News: give top 5 article titles and name of publication and user can choose one to look at by responding with a number 1-5
Maps (Alice)
If you want directions from one place to another, it might return a text form list of instructions via Google Maps
Music (Angie)
Type in a song and it calls you and plays the song
How to get the music: YouTube links?
